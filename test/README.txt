We need Chrome version 73.

We use the python3 and some dependencies. All dependencies are in the requirement.txt.

Since the backend team still not works. To run the tests, start our dummy node server.

And run command "python3 runtests.py"

The log files are in the "log"  folder and the test reports are in the "report" folder.
